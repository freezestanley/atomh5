  how_academy_sto_a_1:
    'Security tokens are digital representations of ownership of assets (e.g. gold, real estate) or economic rights (e.g. a share of profits or revenue). STOs are a form of fundraising involving the offering or issuance of security tokens to investors.',
  how_academy_sto_a_2:
    'Cryptocurrencies, or more broadly cryptoassets, and security tokens are both categorized under the term digital assets (or interchangeably virtual assets). While there is currently no uniform global taxonomy for defining cryptoassets, security tokens are clearly defined and are widely regulated as securities under major jurisdictions.',
  how_academy_sto_a_3:
    'No. Due to the legal status of security tokens as securities, the generally more onerous regulatory regimes applicable to securities will typically apply to STOs in addition to any more recent regulations specific to issuing tokens or other cryptoassets. In contrast, ICOs may be structured without the need to register or comply with securities regulations and regulatory bodies.',
  how_academy_sto_a_4:
    'STO provides a regulated mean of fundraising for companies that do not meet listing requirements or would like to avoid listing fees on stock exchanges. The processes involved in a STO are relatively simpler than that of an IPO and usually take shorter time to roll out to the market.',

  how_academy_bc_q_4: 'How can blockchain make a difference?',
  how_academy_bc_a_1:
    'Blockchain is a database technology that enables secured data synchronization across multiple parties in trust-less and decentralized environments. By leveraging on different types of Blockchains (e.g. public, permissioned and private), we can facilitate collaboration and transaction within B2B or P2P ecosystems. Major use cases include fund raising (e.g. ICO, IEO and STO), supply chain traceability and cross-border payments.',
  how_academy_bc_a_2_1:
    'There is a joke about Smart Contracts. They are neither smart nor contracts. In fact, they are nothing more than pieces of computer codes with logic embedded. The idea is simple: On the occurrence of predetermined actions, something else happens.',
  how_academy_bc_a_2_2:
    'For the case of Security Token trading, smart contract can be used to automate corporate actions like dividend pay-outs.',
  how_academy_bc_a_3_1:
    'Public Blockchains allow any party to join the ecosystem. They aim to facilitate decentralization in trust-less environments.  Commonly used in fundraising and P2P payments, public networks are often constrained by the trilemma of decentralization, security and scalability because of the need of mining (consensus mechanism). Public Blockchain Examples: Bitcoin Blockchain, Ethereum',
  how_academy_bc_a_3_2:
    'Permissioned or Consortium Blockchains allow only verified users to join the ecosystem. They aim to facilitate real-time, secured, B2B data synchronization. Onboarding processes are needed for parties to obtain digital signatures to join the platform. Without the need of mining, the performance and throughput of permissioned networks are usually much higher. This kind of technology is usually used in corporate solutions, use cases include trade finance, bancassurance and Know Your Client (KYC). Permissioned Blockchain Examples: Hyperledger Fabric, Corda R3',
  how_academy_bc_a_4_1:
    'Blockchain or the Distributed Ledger Technology opens up new opportunities in various scenarios. It facilitated collaboration and partnerships within different ecosystems.',
  how_academy_bc_a_4_2:
    'Outside of crypto-assets and fund raising, the top use case of blockchain is trade finance.',
  how_academy_bc_a_4_3:
    'Traditionally, banks do not provide supply chain financing to SMEs because of the duplicate financing problem. But now, by leveraging on cryptographic elements of the blockchain, banks can be more confident in dealing with a new range of clients. Examples of trade finance blockchains include eTradeconnect in Hong Kong and We.trade in Europe.',
